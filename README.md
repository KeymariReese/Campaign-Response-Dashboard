Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior across multiple marketing campaigns to understand who responds, who generates revenue, and where risk emerges. The goal is to evaluate campaign effectiveness and inform targeting decisions using response behavior, spend patterns, discount usage, and complaint rates.

The analysis is presented through a multi-page Power BI dashboard supported by DAX measures and a summary presentation.

Business Questions
This project focuses on answering four core questions:

Is the campaign performing effectively over time?
Which customer segments are most responsive to campaigns?
Which segments actually generate the most value?
Do incentives increase revenue without increasing complaint risk?

Dataset Summary
~2,200 customers

Time period: 2012–2014

Key data includes:
Customer demographics
Purchase behavior by product category
Channel usage (web, store, catalog)
Campaign acceptance history
Complaints and recency metrics

Dashboard Structure
Page 1 — Campaign Performance

Evaluates overall campaign health using response rate, complaint rate, purchase recency, and total spend. Identifies trends in engagement and spending over time.

Page 2 — Value & Spend Behavior

Examines which customer segments generate revenue and how that value is composed, including spend levels, purchase frequency, and discount usage.

Page 3 — Campaign Effectiveness & Risk

Compares responders vs non-responders, revenue per responder, and complaint rates to assess whether campaign incentives drive profitable behavior without increasing risk.

Key Insights:
High-value customers show the highest response rates but are not the top revenue contributors.
Medium-value customers generate the most total spend and exhibit the highest discount usage.
Recently active customers respond significantly more than long-inactive customers.
Complaint rates remain low overall, indicating limited downside risk from targeting strategies.
